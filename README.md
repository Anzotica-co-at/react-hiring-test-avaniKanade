# Update to submission, Demo deployed

The assignment was already submitted on 07/07/2025. Please see the history in this README file towards the end.

But deployment was pending. 

This is an update. The project has now been deployed on netlify and can be accessed by the following URL:
https://reacttest-avani.netlify.app/

The following improvements were made (not updated here):
1. The position feature to position the Info Card over the hotel images was working at the default location bottom-right. But on top-right, it was overlapping the "See What's New" button. Further the positions top-left and bottom-left did not exactly positon the card out of the image. All these problems were fixed.

2. There were some scss based styles that were remaining to be converted to React Styled Components. This was completed for better look and feel and the scss files removed.

However the latest source is not updated here. Waiting for your instructions before updating.

Deloyment done on 08/07/2025 around 5 pm.

## Submission: SUBMITTED ON 07/07/2025 at 23:58 IST.

### What is included
1. Only the top navigation menu is implemented in style and looks. No pages were implemented as targets.
2. The carousel is implemented using Swiper. The properties need to be added to the Properties component's list of properties. There is a feature to even position the description on the image.

The deployment on netlify is not done yet. Will inform when done tomorrow.
